# Heroine-Sickness
After a heroine injection, poppy alkalines wear off in the body faster than the phage meltdown. When the poppy is gone, and the phage is left, people get dope sick. Quit cold turkey, and you end up with HIV...


Take another injection and the poppy milk redoxes the remainder of the first injection which is attacking the body. Thus is why heroinr addicts are afraid to quit. They know what happens when the body runs out of heroine.

Some heroine dealers know that their clients are dying from lack of poppy milk. Some dealera will supply milky heroine to clients who are dope sick.
